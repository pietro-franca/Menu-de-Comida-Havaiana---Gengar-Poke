## Gengar Poke - Hawaiian Food Menu

This repository presents a project I completed during my Computer Science degree at UNESP - Rio Claro.

Basically, it's a program that works like a Hawaiian food menu, where you can create your own poke bowl or choose from pre-made options, personalized with Pok√©mon names. The program offers options for size, assembly, and finished dishes, and at the end, displays the total order price.
